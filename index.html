    <h1>Five in a row Game</h1>

    <p>The rule: Each players' goal is to create an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Since the opening player (the one with black stones) has a significant advantage, an alternative ways of opening the game have been created which are supposed to eliminate the advantage of an opening player.</p>

    <p>Play with arrows and space on your keyboard. The game works only on Desktop.</p>
